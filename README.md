**Setup:** Two players face each other.<br/> 
**Decision:** One player decides if they want to be odds or evens. Let’s say Player A chooses evens.<br/> 
**Gameplay:** Both players simultaneously show any number of fingers from 0 to 5.<br/> 
**Counting:** If the total number of fingers shown by both players is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), Player A wins because they chose evens. <br/> 
If it’s odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), Player B wins because they didn’t choose evens.<br/> 
**Winner:** The player who correctly predicted the total (odd or even) wins that round.<br/> 
**Repeat:** Players can play multiple rounds to determine an overall winner.<br/>
